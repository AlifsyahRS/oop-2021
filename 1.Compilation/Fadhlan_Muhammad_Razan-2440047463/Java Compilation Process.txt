What I have learnt about Java Compilation Process:

We write the java code in a file with the .java extension.
When we then execute the program/file, it is going to be compiled by java compiler into a java bytecode file with the .class extension.
After that, the file is going to be passed to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
JVM is then going to interpret the java bytecode into machine language so that the computer can understand the code and then produces outputs based on the code.
